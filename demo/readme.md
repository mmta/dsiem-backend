# Demo

This is a helper script to quickly run `dsiem-backend` on the main repo [demo environment](https://github.com/defenxor/dsiem/tree/master/demo).

First run `./get.sh` to pull the demo files and patch the image location in `docker-compose.yml`.
After that, execute `./run.sh` to start the containers.
